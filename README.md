# Rename Files
This repository contains a Python script that renames a set of image files in a specified directory for use in AI applications.

This repository contains three Python scripts that can be used to manage machine learning data.

The first script, renameFiles.py, takes a directory location as input and renames all the files inside it. This can be useful when organizing training, validation, and testing datasets, as it is often easier to work with numbered files. The script can handle large numbers of files and automates the renaming process, saving time and effort.

The second script, rename-sub-dir.py, is used to rename labeled data. If you have a directory with thousands of labeled images stored in subdirectories, this script can be used to rename the images inside each subdirectory. This can help to keep your data organized and make it easier to work with during machine learning experiments.

The third script, unlabel.py, can be used to remove labels from labeled training data. If you have thousands of labeled images stored in subdirectories and need to remove the labels, this script automates the process, saving time and effort.

Each script comes with clear instructions for use and can be easily customized to suit your specific needs. These scripts can help to streamline the data management process and make it easier to work with machine learning data.
